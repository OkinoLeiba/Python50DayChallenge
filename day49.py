# Day 49: Create a Database  
# For  this  challenge,  you  are  going  to  create  a  database  using 
# Pythonâ€™s  SQLite.  You  will  import  SQLite  into  your  script. 
# Create a database called movies.db. In that database, you are 
# going  to  create  a  table  called  movies.  In  that  table,  you  are 
# going to save the following movies: 
 
# year title genre 
# 2009 Brothers Drama 
# 2002 Spider Man Sci-fi 
# 2009 WatchMen Drama 
# 2010 Inception Sci-fi 
# 2009 Avatar Fantasy 
 
# a)  Once  you  create  a  table,  run  a  SQL  query  to  see  all  the 
# movies in your table. 
# b) Run another SQL query to select only the movie Brothers 
# from the list. 
# c)  Run  another  SQL  query  to  select  all  movies  that  were 
# released in 2009 from your table. 
# d) Run  another  query  to  select  movies  in  the  fantasy  and 
# drama genre. 
# e)  Run a query to delete all the contents of your table.
