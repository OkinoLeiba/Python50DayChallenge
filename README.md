"The only way to learn a new programming language is by writing programs in it." - Dennis Ritchie

What I always say and know to be true is that physically, intellectual, and mentally; challenges help us grow. Too much of a challenge lead to struggles that could break us and too little we miss the mark. Programming is quintessential about solving problems through code, so it is not so farfetched to learn programming through coding.

Additional Challenges:
At every point in a persons learning journey you get to a place where can only challenging yourself and there is no work like hard work, so to further my understanding of Python and programming & design concepts; I will further challenge myself by giving myself additional challenges by using list comprehensions, lambda functions, generator expressions, etc, and will try using functional programming and utilizing different modules and approaches.
