"The only way to learn a new programming language is by writing programs in it." - Dennis Ritchie


Additional Challenges
In order to further improve upon my understanding of Python and the tools the language provides. I will give myself additional challenges by using list comprehensions, lambda functions, generator expressions, etc, and will try using functional programming and utilizing different modules and approaches.
