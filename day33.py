# Day 33: List Intersection  
# Write a function called inter_section that takes two lists and 
# finds  the  intersection  (the  elements  that  are  present  in  both 
# lists).  The  function  should  return  a  tuple  of  intersections.  Use 
# list  comprehension  in  your  solution.  Use  the  lists  below.  Your 
# function should return (30, 65, 80). 
# list1 = [20, 30, 60, 65, 75, 80, 85] 
# list2 = [ 42, 30, 80, 65, 68, 88, 95] 
 
# Extra Challenge: Set or list 
# You want to implement a code that will search for a number in 
# a range. You have a decision to make as to whether to store the 
# number in a set or a list. Your decision will be based on time. 
# You have to pick a data type that executes faster. 
# You have a range and you can either store it in a set or a list 
# depending on which one executes faster when you are searching 
# for a number in the range. See below: 
# a = range(10000000) 
# x = set(a) 
# y = list(a) 
# Letâ€™s say you are looking for a number 9999999 in the range 
# above.  Search  for  this  number  in  the  list  and  the  set.  Your 
# challenge is to find which code executes faster. You will pick the 
# one that executes quicker, lists, or sets. Run the two searches 
# and time them.
